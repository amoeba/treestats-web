%h2.title Welcome to TreeStats

%h3 What is TreeStats?

%p
  TreeStats is a 
  %a{:href => "http://www.decaldev.com"} Decal
  plugin for 
  %a{:href => "http://turbine.com"} Turbine's
  %a{:href => "http://www.asheronscall.com/"} Asheron's Call
  = ". It uploads information about characters you log into with the plugin running, such as:"

%ul
  %li General information (Name, race, level, etc.)
  %li Attributes, skills, and titles
  %li Augmentations, ratings, and other miscellaneous information

%p 
  Only the information your character knows about (itself, its monarch/patron/vassal names) will be uploaded. You won't get information about players your see while playing (aka it doesn't get information on the players you inspect or are near). For monarch/patron/vassals, only name, race, and rank are collected.

%p
  This website adds a few features on top of the data the plugin collects:

%ul
  %li
    %a{:href => "/player_counts"} Server population counts
  %li Each characters' allegiance chain (so far as they are known)
  %li Each allegiance's tree (so far as it's known)
  %li Rankings for statistics of interest (i.e. level, character age, War Magic skill level)

%h3 What should I do now that I'm here?

%p 
  If you play AC and want your characters' information to be available offline and to the public, go 
  %a{:href => "/download"} download
  and install TreeStats.
