%h3 What is TreeStats?

<p>TreeStats is a <a href="http://www.decaldev.com">Decal</a> plugin for <a href="http://turbine.com">Turbine's</a> <a href="http://www.asheronscall.com/">Asheron's Call</a>. It uploads information about characters you log into with the plugin running, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General information (Name, race, level, etc.)</li>
  <li> Attributes, skills, and titles</li>
  <li>Augmentations, ratings, and other miscellaneous information</li>
</ul>

<p>Only the information your character knows about (itself, its monarch/patron/vassal names) will be uploaded. You won't get information about players your see while playing (aka it doesn't get information on the players you inspect or are near). For monarch/patron/vassals, only name, race, and rank are collected.</p>

<p>This website adds a few features on top of the data the plugin collects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/player_counts">Server population counts</a></li>
  <li>Each characters' allegiance chain (so far as they are known)</li>
  <li>Each allegiance's tree (so far as it's known)</li>
  <li>Rankings for statistics of interest (i.e. level, character age, War Magic skill level)</li>
</ul>
